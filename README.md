# Def-Hacks-Patient

It is an app that builds a platform for both doctors and patients to create, edit and cancel appointments. In this special situation, we want to be able to help people to get medical service when we are keeping social distance. 

## Usage

The backend is built in Express.js, and the database is built in MongoDB. The frontend is built in React. To explore the backend, you can do the following: 

To start the server: 

```
git clone git@github.com:pranavs2004/Def-Hacks-Patient.git
```
Then go to the directory by typing this in the terminal: 

```
cd Def-Hacks-Patient
```
Then you should see your terminal shows that you are in that directory. 

Then you can run `npm install` to install all the packages and `npm start` to start the server. Then the server will be running.
